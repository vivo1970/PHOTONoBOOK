free slideshow demo (limited to 30 slides for 10 minutes)

Limited Slideshow of HDR still photos - AVIF and JPEG
(EXE and PDF file available for download)

To allow everyone—not just supporters, but literally all users—to verify high quality HDR still files using an HDR monitor, here is a free Windows PC software spin off PHOTONoBOOK software development.

PHOTONoBOOK-DEMO.EXE enables users to:
- Confirm a major milestone in PHOTONoBOOK’s development
- Verify their Windows PC supports HDR photo display
- Test HDR image rendering on an HDR display

This free demo software performs these operations:
- Automatically creates a slideshow with 5-second slide intervals
- Displays images in full-screen mode (any screen size)
- Handles both SDR and HDR images
- Processes only HDR-compatible files (JPEG or preferably AVIF) located in “C:\PHOTONoBOOK\images”

Limitations of this free demo slideshow:
- Maximum 30 images (files are selected alphabetically)
- Sequential slide progression stops in 10 minutes
